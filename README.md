# Stage of Light

**Stage of Light** is a Unity project developed for NTNU Art Museum, designed to project dynamic visuals onto physical surfaces such as walls and floors in a room setup. This project combines real-time visual rendering and projection mapping with external systems like Resolume Arena to synchronize the virtual environment with the physical space.

## Features

- **Physical Models**: Represents real-world surfaces for precise projection mapping.
- **Dynamic, Real-time Projections**: Adjusts camera views and projection based on user position for accurate alignment on walls and floors.
- **Spout Integration**: Sends render textures to external projection software (e.g., Resolume Arena).
- **Skybox Calibration**: A 360-degree skybox for alignment and calibration of the physical setup.
